This is for my quick coding experiment

While studying, I have noticed the following. This is my explanation on my own words.

For loop
How does it starts means i = 0
How does it ends means inside the condition i < 10
How does if changes if i still less than 10 iterate using i++


While

Identify a key variable means variable to be compared
Initialize the variable before the loop means create var/let variable above the while 
Identify the condition for the loop means create the condition inside the while
Change the condition inside the loop using logical operator like equal or not equal or identical to


Legend:
index = css + javascript.
index2 = vanilla javascript.
